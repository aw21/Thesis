\section{Summary of Major Work that Needs to be Done}
\begin{itemize}
\item Continue collecting data
\item Estimate parameters with full dataset
\item Write code to simulate LOB with estimated parameters and agent decisions
\item Run trading strategies in simulated environment and evaluate performance,
\item Write results in thesis
\end{itemize}

\section{Rough Timeline}
\begin{itemize}
\item By the end of February, I will have the full data-set that spans several weeks (I already have code to estimate the parameters).
\item By the end of February, I also hope to have market simulation code written as described by the algorithm in \ref{ch:experiment}.
\item By mid-March, I hope to have analyzed the performance of various trade execution strategies (completing the experimental procedure)
\item I will spend the rest of March and April writing the thesis.
\end{itemize}
