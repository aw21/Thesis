\section{Summary of Major Work that Needs to be Done}
\begin{itemize}
\item Update the above code to estimate the Poisson arrival rates of events for the model.
\item Use the values of AES, $\lambda_i(q)$, and $\gamma_i(q$) to build a market simulation that allows for updates in real time.
\item Build a reinforcement learning model for optimal trading execution that uses the environment from the simulation above.
\item Compare performance to benchmark strategies and for multiple currencies.
\item Write the thesis in \LaTeX{}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Rough Timeline}
\begin{itemize}
\item By the end of the semester in December, I hope to have code written that simulates the market using the queue reactive model.
\item By January, I hope to have preliminary code running for a reinforcement learning model based on this simulation.
\item By February, I hope to have revised the code, tweaked hyperparameters, collected enough data, etc. to evaluate the performance of my model with meaningful results to write my thesis.
\item By the April deadline, I really hope to have my thesis written.
\end{itemize}
