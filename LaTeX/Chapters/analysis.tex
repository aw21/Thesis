\section{Experimental Results}
Here, I will present the results of the experiment and analyze the output. I will discuss performance of the model any insights received from the experiment.
\section{Model Evaluation}
Here, I will compare the performance of the model to other common methods of optimal trade execution.
\section{Feasibility of Model}
Here, I will discuss the feasibility of the model on other real-world data-sets. I will discuss how realistic the queue reactive model is for modelling LOB dynamics, as well as how well I expect the reinforcement learning model to generalize to other data-sets. I will then discuss any limitations that I had when working on the thesis and whether they could be overcome.
