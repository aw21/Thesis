The electronic nature of markets today has allowed traders to infer information from limit order book (LOB) data and execute trades based on this information. In this paper, I attempt to solve the problem of optimal trade execution using simulated market data. Given the current state of the limit order book for a particular asset and the amount to buy (or sell), I model the problem as a Markov decision process and output the orders to place at each time step. The simulated environment allows me to evaluate a trading strategy while updating LOB dynamics in real time to take into account the agent's market impact. I first use high frequency LOB data to simulate LOB dynamics with real-time market impact adjustments using a modified version of the queue reactive model developed by Huang et al. (2013). I then evaluate the performance of common trade execution strategies in the simulated environment. The findings from this paper are relevant for institutions who want to execute trades while minimizing cost as well as those interested in simulating trades in a market.
