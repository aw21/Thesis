# Introduction

My name is Andrew Wang and I'm a senior at Princeton University in the class of 2019 studying Operations Research and Financial Engineering (ORFE). This is the code and writeup of my senior thesis. I am simulating a LOB using a queueing model and parameters estimated from the 'ETC-USD' market on Coinbase Pro.
